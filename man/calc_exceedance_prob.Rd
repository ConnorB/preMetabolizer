\title{Calculate Flow Exceedence Probabilities}
\usage{
calc_exceedance_prob(flow, rm.zero = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{flow}{A numeric vector of flow (discharge) values.}

\item{rm.zero}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, zero values are removed from the calculation, and
positions corresponding to zeros are filled with \code{NA} in the output.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of exceedance probabilities. If \code{rm.zero = TRUE}, the returned vector
will have the same length as the input with \code{NA} at positions of zero values.
}
\description{
This function calculates the exceedance probability for a given numeric vector of flow values.
The exceedance probability is calculated using the Weibull plotting position formula.
}
\details{
The Weibull plotting position is used to compute the exceedance probability:
\deqn{P = \frac{\text{rank}}{n + 1}}
where \code{rank} is the rank of the flow value (in descending order), and \code{n} is the
number of observations.
}
\examples{
flow_data <- c(10, 5, 0, 15, 8, NA, 0, 20)
exceedance_probs <- calc_exceedance_prob(flow_data)
exceedance_probs_no_zeros <- calc_exceedance_prob(flow_data, rm.zero = TRUE)
