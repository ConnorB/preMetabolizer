\usage{
get_noaa_stations(state = NULL, clean = TRUE, debug = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{state}{Optional character string specifying a two-letter U.S. state code to filter stations.}

\item{clean}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), returns processed and cleaned data; if \code{FALSE}, returns raw data.}

\item{debug}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), outputs debug messages during data download and processing.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing NOAA station metadata. Columns include station identifiers, names, location (latitude, longitude), elevation, operational dates, and more.
}
\description{
Downloads, processes, and optionally cleans NOAA station metadata from the Meteorological Station Historical Repository (MSHR).
}
\details{
This function retrieves and processes data from NOAA's Meteorological Station Historical Repository (MSHR). The data include detailed information about meteorological stations, including their geographic coordinates, elevation, operational status, and identifiers across various systems (e.g., GHCND, WBAN, FAA).

If the data file already exists in a cached location and is up-to-date, the cached data is loaded to improve performance.

When \code{clean = TRUE}, the function processes the raw data by:
\itemize{
\item Parsing dates and filtering invalid or missing coordinate values.
\item Filtering out balloon platforms.
\item Aggregating station data to consolidate records by station identifier (\code{GHCND_ID}).
}

If a state code is provided via the \code{state} parameter, the returned data will be limited to stations located within that state.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Retrieve and clean all NOAA stations
all_stations <- get_noaa_stations()

# Retrieve raw data for stations in California
ca_stations_raw <- get_noaa_stations(state = "CA", clean = FALSE)

# Retrieve cleaned data for stations in Texas with debug messages
tx_stations <- get_noaa_stations(state = "TX", debug = TRUE)
}
